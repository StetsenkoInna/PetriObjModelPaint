# PetriObjModelPaint

A Java-based Petri Net modeling and simulation tool with graphical interface supporting PNML (Petri Net Markup Language) import/export functionality according to ISO/IEC 15909 standard.
Notice: AbsoluteLayout.jar library should be added to the project if not NetBeans IDE is used.

PetriObjModelPaint is the project of Petri-object simulation technique implementation. Petri-object simulation technique, the main concept of which is to compose the code of model of complicated discrete event system in a fast and flexible way, simultaneously providing fast running the simulation, is requisite. The behaviour description of the model based on stochastic multichannel Petri net while the model composition is grounded on object-oriented technology. The Petri-object simulation software provides scalable simulation algorithm, graphical editor, correct transformation graphical images into model, correct simulation results. Graphical editor helps to cope with error-prone process of linking elements with each other. Petri-object simulation software is developed using Java language. It consists of package PetriObjLib implementing Petri-object simulation algorithm and the packages providing graphical presentation of nets. The graphical editor helps to build Petri net, save it as a Java method and add method to the NetLibrary class. The opening net from file or reproducing net from Java method are supported by the software. In addition, animation of simulation is provided to check the rightness of created Petri net. It should be noted, exception will be generated if Petri net consists a transition which has not input or output places. After successful saving, the method can be used to create Petri-objects. When the list of Petri-objects is prepared and the links between objects are determined, the model can be created using PetriObjModel class. The method go(double time) of this class run the simulation. Exception will be generated if a time delay generator will produce a negative value. Software main responsibilities are to provide correct simulation algorithm and correct simulation results including mean values of markers in Petri net places, mean value of buffers in transitions and the state of Petri net in the last moment of simulation.

java -version
mvn -version
```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Build and Run (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StetsenkoInna/PetriObjModelPaint.git
   cd PetriObjModelPaint
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   java -jar petri-obj-paint/target/petri-obj-paint-1.2.0.jar
   ```

#### Option 2: Use Convenience Scripts

After building the project, you can use the provided scripts:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  run.bat
  ```

- **Linux/macOS:**
  ```bash
  ./run.sh
  ```

#### Option 3: Maven Exec Plugin

```bash
cd petri-obj-paint
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ua.stetsenkoinna.graphpresentation.PetriNetsFrame"
```

## PNML Import/Export

The application supports importing and exporting Petri nets in PNML format:

### Import PNML
- **Menu:** File → Import PNML (Ctrl+I)
- **Supported elements:** Places, transitions, arcs with weights, initial markings
- **Extensions:** Time delays, priorities, probabilities via toolspecific elements

### Export PNML
- **Menu:** Save → Export to PNML (Ctrl+P)
- **Format:** ISO/IEC 15909 compliant PNML files
- **Preservation:** All Petri net properties and custom attributes

## Building from Source

### Development Build
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

### Create Distribution JAR
```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

### Run Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Ensure Java 8+ is installed and in your PATH
- Check that the JAR file was built successfully in `petri-obj-paint/target/`
- Try running with: `java -jar petri-obj-paint/target/petri-obj-paint-1.2.0.jar`

### Build Failures
- Ensure Maven 3.6+ is installed
- Check internet connection (Maven downloads dependencies)
- Try: `mvn clean install -U -DskipTests`

### PNML Import Issues
- Verify your PNML file follows ISO/IEC 15909 standard
- Check console output for detailed error messages
- Ensure XML is well-formed and uses correct namespace

### Performance Issues
- For large nets, consider increasing Java heap size:
  ```bash
  java -Xmx2g -jar petri-obj-paint/target/petri-obj-paint-1.2.0.jar
  ```
